Yolov5 is the most widely used machine learning algorithm for the detection and prediction applications. This project consists of the custom dataset and the annotations were carried out using labalimg toolbox. This model is specifically designed in a manner to detect the bounding boxes for the training and the training of the bounding boxes resulted in prediction of the helmets/no helmets in the project. The bounding boxes of the images were created using the Labelimg toolbox. The dataset used for the project consists of the custom image dataset.
